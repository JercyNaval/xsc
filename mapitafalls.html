It is a God-given scenery of amazing view deck, cascading waterfalls and lagoons of various sizes, shapes and depths. Nature-lovers can have a breath of fresh and cool breeze while having sight of the plains of the Province of Pangasinan and a glimpse of the West Philippine sea. The Summer capital of Pangasinan as fondly named is surrounded by lush greeneries and rock formations offering a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life aside from it soon to be the center of educational tours as it now houses two solar power Plants with 68kVA and 73 kVAp respectively.</p>
